# MDDN 242 Project 1: Time-based Media  

## Dilly dallying clock- Oriana Vitolio

**Inspiration**


This idea was inspired by the youtube 'lofi girl' but also mirrors what we as students in this class are actually doing for this project (coding a clock in our own space as well as on campus). 

For this design, I think I'm more inclined to focus on the aesthetic side of the outer layout compared to actually have most of the design/aesthetic on the clock itself. Although the case, I can definitly say that this is out of my knowledge range when it comes to knowing how to code such components and also not quite sure if it follows what the brief asks of us. But have been thinking of illustrating each component individually.

**Maeda clock work**

I had practiced coding with the second clock example given (I had changed the colours just to look play around). Although I was able to code it, the next step for me would be to incorporate other code such as loops, variables etc because I only have _circle();_ as of now.

**Clock update** 
I, unfortunately, had trouble adding in my drawings/images and could not figure out how to change each according to the responsive part (seconds etc). Because of this I decided to change my idea and make it more simple and achievable to code and complete. I restarted on Tuesday and have been able to get seconds and minutes to react to an element on the screen. - Digit change for minutes (still need to fix a few issues)_ and an arc connecting for seconds.

Above are screenshots of my final clock design. Although completely different to my first initial sketches, I am satisfied with the outcome. 
I have decided to call this clock the _dilly-dallying clock_ to not only relate to the design but also relate to my process of creation. 

_"waste time through aimless wandering or indecision"_. I can relate to the indecision situation as there were many times I would add and subtract different ideas (can see from code uploads). I was able to stick to my final idea up until only a few hours before hand-in.

To describe the design; I have just made a simple clock that can change from 'day' and 'night' depending on the time. When the alarm is counting down, I made it so that the change and colours to the text add some sort of panic to the user but once the alarm goes off, the user can feel calm and 'dilly dally' while looking at the relaxing alarm. The way the idea came around was really from me just playing around with code so I can't really supply image inspiration. By doing this project I was able to get back to understanding p5js but also learn other components which I can hopefully apply to in the next project.
