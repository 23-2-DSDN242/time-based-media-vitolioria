## MDDN 242 Project 1: Time-based Media  

**Lecture One: Getting started**

(preview.jpg)

This idea was inspired by the youtube 'lofi girl' but also mirrors what we as students in this class are actually doing for this project (coding a clock in our own space as well as on campus). 

For this design, I think I'm more inclined to focus on the aesthetic side of the outer layout compared to actually have most of the design/aesthetic on the clock itself. Although the case, I wanted to make most of the components within the image react/respond to the time and clock (mentioned in image). 

As of now, I can definitly say that this is out of my knowledge range when it comes to knowing how to code such components and also not quite sure if it follows what the brief asks of us.

**Maeda clock work**

I had practiced coding with the second clock example given (I had changed the colours just to look play around). Although I was able to code it, the next step for me would be to incorporate other code such as loops, variables etc because I only have _circle();_ as of now.
